Hello everyone!

I have the Sony WH-1000XM4 headset. It is an excellent headset with high-quality audio, but Ubuntu is a total mess (probably in all the Linux ecosystem).

For now, the solution I found to get a great audio quality in Ubuntu is installing the package: `pulseaudio-module-bluetooth`, and that's it.

You could be able to change the audio profile in the sound settings.

Thanks for reading this post. 
See you, space cowboy.

***PS: If the OS doesn't recognize or won't connect to the headset, restart the headset.***
